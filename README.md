<h1>Enron Data Analysis</h1>

The Enron email corpus is one of the most famous in data science and machine learning. My investigation of the features provided by Udacity's ML Final Project was an attempt to sift out meaningful trends and, notably, to achieve precision and recall scores above 0.3 -- this report will detail my process, results and commandline output towards those goals.

SelectKBest and KNeighbors model with scores:

Accuracy: 0.88973	Precision: 0.63369	Recall: 0.41000	F1: 0.49787	F2: 0.44114
